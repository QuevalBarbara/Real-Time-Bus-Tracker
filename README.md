<h1>Real Time Bus Tracking</h1>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>During the week 9, the exercise was to use an API to source real-time data of the Boston MBTA busses. We had to display the live location of the busses on a map of city.</p>

<h2>How to run</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clone the repository into your local environment</li>
<li>Navigate to https://account.mapbox.com/ and create an account</li>
<li>Generate your own token access</li>
<li>Open the mapanimation.js file and add your token in the <your key here></li>
<li>Open the index.html file</li>
<li>Right click and select 'Open Default browser' to open the project in your default browser. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Roadmap of future improvements</h3>
<p>Use a real time GPS tracking to see where is the bus in real time.</p>
